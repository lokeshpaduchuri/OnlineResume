<ul>
<li>Technologies Used: Android Programming and Bluetooth API</li>
<li>Description:</li>
<ul>
<li>Developed an android application in Eclipse using android programming which uses the Bluetooth API.</li>
<li>One device acts as a relay allowing the transmission between other 2 devices which cannot directly connect using Bluetooth.</li>
<li>We used the Bluetooth technology for the communication between the devices when an audio file is sent from the source to the destination using the 3rd device that acts as a relay.</li>
<li>The audio file used for the transmission is converted into byte code by the sender which is later converted to mp3 format at the receiver.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Technologies Used: Eclipse, Java programming, JUnit and JoCoCo</li>
<li>Description:</li>
<ul>
<li>This simulation is used to train some basic flight operations.</li>
<li>In this project I reviewed the requirements and developed test cases for complete requirements coverage.</li>
<li>We used the developed test cases using Junit to achieve full code coverage using white box testing techniques and MC/DC technique.</li>
<li>All the results are shown in the GUI using java which can be used as a sample simulation.</li>
</ul></ul><br>
<li id="MASTERS"><h3>Cloud Projects &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; Aug 2014 - Dec 2014</h3></li>
<ul>
<li>Technologies Used: DropBox API, Amazon S3, EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, Google App Engine, Eclipse, Java programming, Python and Hadoop</li>
<li>Description:</li>
<ul>
<li>Developed an application for DropBox API which allows the file uploaded by the user to be encrypted and signed and when downloaded its decrypted and verified in Eclipse using Java.</li>
<li>Developed an application that uses Apache Hadoop mappers and reducers. We tried to analyze the climatic dataset of a region to find out monthly and seasonal maximum temperatures. We used EC2 instance to do this. </li>
<li>Developed application which stores data in S3 buckets and also stores the data into DynamoDB. We using RDS to scale the database.</li>
<li>Developed an application which uploads Data of sizes 10k,30k,60k and 1000k tuples into the Google Cloud SQL. The times are noted down and the data is retrieved using MySQL.</li>
</ul><br>
</ul>
<li id="MASTERS"><h3>Follow Me App &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; Aug 2014 - Dec 2014</h3></li>
<ul>
<li>Technologies Used: Android Programming, Parse Server, Java and Eclipse</li>
<li>Description:</li>
<ul>
<li>Developed an android application in Eclipse using android programming.</li>
<li> This applications helps students to maintain their daily schedule and track their academic progress based on their major.</li>
<li>We used Parse Server to store the data and access the stored data.</li>
</ul><br>

<li id="MASTERS"><h3>Health Demographics of Patients  &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; Oct 2014 - Dec 2014</h3></li>
<ul>
<li>Technologies Used: Weka, Java and Eclipse</li>
<li>Description:</li>
<ul>
<li>Developed an application which uses weka to find the demographics of patientâ€™s dataset of size 2000 tuples. </li>
<li> Various conclusions were drawn about the health statistics on a website developed using Java and JSP. </li>
<li>The doctor can analyze these results and draw conclusions with the help of different graphs drawn in Eclipse using weka.</li>
